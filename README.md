# Kiss2D
Kiss2D is an HTML5 game engine for 2D games.
* Built with Bridge.net, so it supports C# and TypeScript as well as JavaScript
* Designed to be simple, so newbies can get started faster and guys like me can build games faster
* I'm far from an expert on the licensing stuff, but one thing's for sure: it's gonna be free.
